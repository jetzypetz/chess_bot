## üß† How It Works

### Bitboard Representation
At the heart of Cagnus Marlsen is its **bitboard architecture**, which encodes the state of the chessboard into a 64-bit unsigned integer (`uint64_t`). Each bit represents a square, enabling:

- **Blazing Move Generation**: Compute moves with optimized bitwise operations.
- **Compact Memory Footprint**: Efficiently store and process board states.

### Interactive mode

For the coders out there, change the `src/main.cpp` file and use the line `play_me(argv[2], argv[4])` to play against the bot in real time.

### AI Logic
The chess engine incorporates:

- **Move Validation**: Ensures legality of all moves according to FIDE rules.
- **Position Evaluation**: Assigns scores to board states for optimal decision-making.
- **Future Expansion**: Planned implementations of minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and advanced heuristics.
